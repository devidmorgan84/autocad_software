# AutoCAD: The Industry Standard for Computer-Aided Design

## Introduction

AutoCAD is a commercial computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting software application developed and marketed by Autodesk. First released in December 1982, AutoCAD has evolved into one of the most widely used CAD software packages in the world. It is utilized by architects, engineers, construction professionals, and designers across various industries to create precise 2D and 3D drawings and models.
